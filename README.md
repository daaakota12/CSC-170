for Prof. Wright CSC-170-003

Bug catcher is my simple and exciting game created on Greenfoot
The player hits the right or left arrow on the keyboard which moves them accross the ground
Falling from above are bugs that need to be collected
if you collect 10 bugs before 5 hit the ground you win the game
if you let 5 bugs reach the ground before you catch the 10 bugs, you lose.
There is a scoreboard which states how many points you have vs how many misses.
This world starts with 3 main actors all visible on the screen.
The catcher is controlled by the player who moves from left to right
The bug falls from the top and needs to be collected in order to win the game.
The ground is along the whole bottom and catches the falling bugs, counting as misses.
Created 3 main actors
Player controlled movement
actor collision detection
scoring and miss tracking
win and lose messages
